# RL
The main goal is to write codes that are as simple and close to the algorithms from the book "Foundations of Deep Reinforcement Learning: Theory and Practice in Python" (Addison-Wesley Data & Analytics Series). as possible.
The algorithms are implemented here:
* REIFORCE
* SARSA
* DQN (2 varieties)
* A2C
